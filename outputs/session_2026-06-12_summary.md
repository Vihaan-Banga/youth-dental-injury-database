# Session summary — 2026-06-12 (overnight)

Read this when you wake up.

## Headline

**Cleared the orphaned working tree, made a real dent in the `needs_additional_review` pile via full-text review, fully developed the methods paper with verified numbers, and shipped an interactive Rate Explorer on the public site.** Everything is committed locally (5 commits); **nothing pushed** — push when you're ready (`git push`).

| Working tree | 3 orphaned files | **clean** |

## What I did, in commit order

1. **Committed the 3 orphaned files** from the prior session (`scripts/30_oa_url_lookup.py`, `scripts/_pdf_upload_server.py`, `outputs/needs_additional_review_oa_urls.csv`). The OA lookup had found free full-text URLs for 24 of the 91 `needs_additional_review` records.

2. **Full-text review of the open-access `needs_additional_review` subset.** Wrote `scripts/31_pmc_availability.py` (PubMed→PMC) — 8 of 91 have free PMC full text. Fetched everything reachable (PMC HTML, repository PDFs read with `pdfplumber`, OA-journal redirects) and reviewed against PROTOCOL §3.1/§3.3. **Resolved 7 records (91 → 84):**
   - **Included → extracted: `halabchi2007`** (women's Shotokan karate championships, Iran; 3 tooth avulsion/subluxation of 186 injuries). First Iran source, first dedicated `martial_arts_other` row. → master.csv 425→426 rows, 105→106 sources.
   - **Full-text excluded ×6:** `exadaktylos2004` (Swiss ED maxillofacial, E-age), NZ rugby ecological MG study (E-age), LA adolescent orofacial trauma (E-offtop, 3% sport), international field hockey (E-age), Finnish ice-hockey facial fractures (E-age), `tadmor2025` rugby-league concussion (E-nodent — brain concussion, no dental outcome).
   - One reviewed but kept pending: `40662680` Swiss Muay Thai (age table wouldn't extract cleanly).
   - Audit trail: `docs/decisions.md` (2 new dated entries), `scripts/screening_overrides.py` (per-record full-text notes), `outputs/needs_additional_review_fulltext_review_2026-06-12.md` (every fetch attempt + outcome). Regenerated `sources.md`, screening report, SQLite, bibliography, country breakdown, sport factsheets, figures.
   - Fixed `scripts/26_bibliography.py` (now includes full-text-promoted `included` records; bib 93→94).

3. **Methods paper fully developed** (`outputs/methods_paper_draft.md`). Filled every bracket I could with verified current numbers (426 rows / 106 sources / 29 countries / 1996–2026; 32 scripts; 436 screened; 23 PMC; 36 sports; 29 AE-comparable rows; 41 mouthguard). Added the missing C8 validator check, a real Data Records study-type breakdown, a complete Technical Validation section, and working pandas + SQLite Usage Notes examples (all verified to actually run). Only advisor/DOI/external-citation brackets remain.

4. **Doc consistency fixes.** Corrected stale counts in `docs/index.md` (407→426 etc.), `outputs/factsheet.md`, `outputs/advisor_outreach_brief.md`, `outputs/needs_additional_review_status.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md`. Fixed a real bug in `scripts/03_apply_screening_to_sources.py`: the screening-summary percentage was hardcoded `/200`, producing a `screened_excluded: 251 (125%)` — now uses the real denominator and lists the `included`/`extracted`/`fulltext_excluded` statuses.

5. **Interactive Rate Explorer** (`docs/rate-explorer.html` + `scripts/33_rate_explorer_data.py` → `docs/rate_explorer_data.json`). Self-contained static page (no CDN deps) on the existing Jekyll site. Pick a sport + age group → see cited dental-injury rates, native denominators, and mouthguard effect sizes (e.g. labella2002: 0.67 non-MG vs 0.12 MG users), each with its source citation. **Framed exactly as you specified: a population rate explorer, NOT an individual risk calculator**, with a prominent limitations banner. Linked from the landing page. Tested in-browser (dropdowns, filters, empty states, the new karate row) — renders cleanly, no console errors.

## State of the gap list (from the handoff)

- **Advisor / OSF / 20% reliability / Zenodo DOI** — still gated on you (unchanged; I don't touch these).
- **`needs_additional_review`** — 91 → 84. Of the remaining 84, ~18 have *some* open access (paywalled-OA or scanned PMC — a browser session via Chrome MCP could reach a few more) and **66 have no open access at all** (genuinely need advisor library access).
- **Methods paper** — was a skeleton; now a substantially complete draft pending only advisor input and a couple of external citations.

## Highest-value next actions (for you)

1. **Advisor outreach** remains the single biggest unblock — it gates OSF, the reliability re-screen, the 66 no-OA records, and the methods-paper author fields.
2. When ready: `git push` these 5 commits (I left them local per convention).
3. Optional: have me drive Chrome MCP through the ~15 reachable-but-paywalled `needs_additional_review` PDFs in a future session.
4. Review the Rate Explorer framing/styling and tell me what to change — it's a v1 draft.

## Notes

- All 5 commits use `Vihaan-Banga@users.noreply.github.com`.
- master.csv validates at **0 FAILs / 0 WARNs** throughout.
- No data was invented; every new number traces to a source citation or a master.csv computation.
